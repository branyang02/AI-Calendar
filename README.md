### Overview
UVA AI Maps is a web application that integrates Google Maps and an AI chatbot to assist UVA students in choosing locations on campus for various activities such as dining, studying, etc., based on their class schedule.

The application allows students to upload their calendars and, upon admin approval, the AI chatbot provides advice on things to do around campus before or after their calendar events. The recommendations are personalized based on the student's schedule and are reflected on the map for easy navigation.

In addition to the AI assistant's recommendations, students can use the provided map filters to search for places to study, eat, or relax. They can also view favorite locations submitted by other users and add their own favorite locations if they wish.

### Getting Started
